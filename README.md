# Day2 print-date-time

This uses the date command with formatting:
date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

%Y â†’ Year
%m â†’ Month 
%d â†’ Day 
%H â†’ Hour (24-hour format)
%M â†’ Minutes
%S â†’ Seconds

# Day4 Copy and Move Files Script

cp -v
- This uses the cp (copy) command to copy all files from the source directory ($SOURCE_DIR) to the destination directory ($DEST_DIR).
- The -v flag makes the command verbose, meaning it will print each file being copied.
mv -v
- This uses the mv (move) command to move a specific file (old_file.txt) from the source directory to the destination directory and renames it as new_file.txt.
cp -iv
- This command uses cp with the -i flag for interactive copying. It prompts the user for confirmation before overwriting existing files in the destination directory.
cp -r
- The -r flag in the cp command tells it to copy directories recursively, meaning it will copy not only files but also any subdirectories and their contents from the source to the destination.

# Day5 List all files in a folder

- ls = list files
- ls -la = list all files(including hidden)
- ls -ltr = provides content like properties of file and folder

# Day6 Take input from user

read -p "Enter your name: " name
echo "Hello, $name! ðŸ‘‹"

- (-p option lets you give a prompt directly inside read.)

# Day7 Check if file exsist

- read -p âž” Asks the user to input the filename.
- if [ -f "$filename" ] âž” Checks if that file exists and is a regular file.
- then echo "File exists" âž” If true, prints success.
- else echo "File does not exist" âž” If not, prints failure.

If you want to check if a file exists, you'd use -f like this:
If you want to check if a directory exists, you'd use -d like this:

# Day8 Create multiple users from a file

- cut -d: -f1 /et/passwd = To list all users on system
- cat /etc/passwd | grep username = If you want to list all users created during this session
- sudo userdel -r username = delete user along with home directory

# Day 9 Create backup folder

The main command that:

| tar -cvf | tar -xvf | tar -xzvf | tar -czvf | tar -xyfz |

- c â†’ Creates an archive by bundling files and directories together.	
- z â†’ Compresses it using gzip.
- v â†’ Verbose mode (shows you which files are being added).
- f â†’ Specifies the filename of the archive to be created or extracted.
- x â†’ Extracts files and directories from an existing archive.
- z â†’ gzip compression resulting in a compressed archive with the â€˜.tar.bz2â€™ extension.

- tar -xyfz demo.tar.gz = untar
